# BioTreeBridge

An interactive visualization and transformation tool that bridges Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) schema and FHIR healthcare standards. BioTreeBridge renders complex hierarchical data structures as navigable tree visualizations while providing seamless conversion between these two critical biomedical data formats.

## Features
- Interactive D3.js based tree visualization of [HTAN schema hierarchy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ncihtan/data-models/main/HTAN.model.jsonld)
- Bidirectional transformation between HTAN bioschemas and FHIR resources
- Support for mapping tumor atlas data elements to healthcare interoperability standards
- Customizable visualization with focused views on specific branches
- Python-based data processing pipeline for schema transformation

## Purpose
BioTreeBridge facilitates interoperability between cancer research and clinical healthcare systems, enabling researchers and clinicians to leverage tumor atlas data within standard healthcare workflows while maintaining semantic integrity across systems.
